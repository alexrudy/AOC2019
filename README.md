# AOC 2019

Well into 2020, I attempt [Advent Of Code]() for 2019. In Rust.

## Usage

Run with the first argument as the day. The second argument is an optional input file, though my puzzle inputs
are incldued in `puzzles` and will be used by default.

```
cargo run -- 1
```

## Tests

There are some tests... run `cargo test` to watch them go!
